<h2 class="case-b-title">PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p><strong>Last updated November 23, 2020</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; Respecting Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Privacy is a fundamental right, and at ZedAid a digital portal for charity activities established by Zuci Education & Development Foundation, it is treated as such. This document sets forth our current policy in this regard.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; Sources of Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>Our platform is founded on the principle that people matters, respect for people and help the needy are the foundation of our business. Respect for people includes respecting their right to privacy.</p>
<p>We are engaged in the activities of using innovative ways to bring help to all in needy elements of the society. Our website seeks to bring cases of those in need of necessities to the attention of those in a position to make a difference and provide the opportunity to meet those necessities. The users of our website are those in need and those seeking to help.</p>
<p>In the conduct of our business, we collect and process personal data of our users and visitors. Personal data is collected in the course of transacting on the website. Personal data is also collected by ZedAid and its affiliates outside of website through in-person meetings, participation in conferences and other forums, transactions or promotion of various campaigns, and with respect to job applicants, through job application materials and interviews. Personal data is also collected through social media; from solicited and unsolicited communications; responses to promotional and other materials, among others. If your personal data is available with us, more likely than not, it has been shared by you with us.</p>
<p>Data collection technologies built into our websites, telecommunication systems, digital advertising, social media, etc. are additional sources of personal data collection. In addition to personal data that a user voluntarily furnishes, these electronic systems also collect personal data without the knowledge of the user, including user’s preferences, frequency of access, IP addresses, type of browser, communication device or operating systems used, and geographic location, etc.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; Processing of Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>We acquire, maintain and process personal data where it is necessary for the pursuit of legitimate business interests, balancing this interest against the data subject’s interests and fundamental rights. Legitimate interests include establishing and maintaining relationships, servicing their anticipated and actual needs, and for administrative purposes. Towards that end, we may use various contact management, analytics and processing software and other tools and techniques, including marketing by use of electronic means.</p>
<p>We may share personal data with entities that provide services to us, including companies that provide web analytics, advertising, email distribution and other services. The use of personal data by such companies is limited to the purpose of rendering the contracted services.</p>
<p>We may share personal data with one or more of our group companies or donors for performance of campaign functions and for internal analytics. </p>
<p>We may also process personal data where it is necessary for entering into or performing under a contract. Finally, in certain circumstances, we may process personal data on the basis of consent of the data subject for specific purposes.</p>
<p>We may also use or disclose personal data if we are required by law to do so or if we reasonably believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with judicial or regulatory proceedings, a court order or other legal process. We do not otherwise disclose or sell to any third party any personal data that we collect or which comes into our possession without the consent of the data subject. The only exception to the foregoing is where any part of our business is sold to a third party, in which case the acquiror of the business will likely also acquire personal data in our possession or control.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp; Right to Object and Unsubscribe</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to object to your personal data being used for direct marketing by us. You may opt out by adjusting your communication preferences by logging into your profile and turning off the communication or by writing to <a href="mailto:info@zedaid.org">[info@zedaid.org]</a>. You also have the right to unsubscribe from electronic communications by utilizing the unsubscribe feature contained in our emails. Note that the unsubscribe feature contained in an email may unsubscribe you from only certain (but not all) kinds of electronic or non-electronic communications originating from us.</p>
<p>Also, by continuing to the next step, you are willingly giving ZedAid, permission to contact you or communicate to you and all the contacts given by you via whatsapp, email, sms, and other modes of notification.</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; Notice to EU Data Subjects</strong></p>
<p>As noted above, we process personal data with the consent of the data subject, to enter into or perform under a contract between us and the data subject or a business represented by the data subject, to comply with legal obligations, or where we have a legitimate interest to do so.</p>
<p>Further, as noted above, subject to the exceptions permitted by law, a data subject has the right to access her or his information, rectify or update such information, erase such information (subject to our need to retain certain information for legal or other purposes), receive a copy of the data subject’s information, and to object to or restrict the processing of such subject’s personal data. The data subject may do so by writing to us at <a href="mailto:info@zedaid.org">[info@zedaid.org]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp; Third-Party Activities</strong></p>
<p>Unaffiliated third parties, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. are providers of avenues, content, functionality and services for our web and social media sites. We do not control what and how these and other third parties collect personal data or how they use it. We do know, however, that in addition to using sophisticated technologies such as cookies and web beacons on web and social media sites, including sites such as ours, third parties routinely employ new and innovative tools, techniques and practices to collect, receive, process, buy and sell personal information over extended durations, build sophisticated user profiles and commercially exploit it. We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy and business practices of these third parties. Note here that certain of their activities can potentially be managed by users themselves, as for instance, through Internet browser and handheld app controls.</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp; Children’s Information</strong></p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or store personal data of children unless permitted by law or provided to us under a contract where a child is a beneficiary of a campaign. If we learn that we have collected personally identifiable information from a child without lawful authorization, we will delete that information from our database.</p>
<p><strong>8.&nbsp; Protecting Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>We use physical, technical and administrative measures to protect personal data against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. We strive to protect the information we maintain; however, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that is transmitted to or held by us because data transmission and storage is neither error-free nor completely secure.</p>
<p><strong>9.&nbsp; Data Retention</strong></p>
<p>We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected and processed, including for the purposes of satisfying any contractual, legal, regulatory, accounting or reporting obligations.</p>
<p><strong>10.&nbsp; ZedAid Advertisement and Targeting</strong></p>
<p>Advertisements are a basic need in today’s digital world for any organization to grow its digital footprint.</p>
<p>ZedAid leverages advertisements via various mediums to fulfill the donation needs of any of its numerous crowdSourcing campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Why am I being shown so many ads from ZedAid?</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; Since you visited zedaid.org:</strong> In the past, you have visited Zed AID website or any campaign and support someone in need.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; Because you donated on ZedAid:</strong>In the past, you have helped someone get through their tough time by donating to their campaign.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; Affinity Targeting:</strong> According to advertising platforms like Youtube, Facebook, Google, etc, you are among the people who care for social causes and feel compassionate about other people who are going through pain.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp; You follow us on social media:</strong> You are currently following ZedAid (or used to follow ZedAid) on one of the social media platforms that ZedAid has a presence on.</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; You have helped someone:</strong> by sharing, liking, commenting or promoting their crowdSourcing campaign in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Why does ZedAid need to show ads?</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; By showing ads to people across the world, ZedAid will be able to raise donations and help thousands of people.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; ZedAid is trying to make the world a better place. <br>ZedAid uses technology to bring people together and help each other. Basically, we connect beneficiaries, NGOs in need with donors. Often advertisements help us break the clutter and reach out to people like you and help people in need.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp; Urgent support: Many times, people need donations urgently and do not have any time to wait for people to find their campaign. ZedAid helps them to reach their target fast by promoting their campaigns.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp; Lack of personal resources: Many underprivileged people, who come from low-income backgrounds and need a large sum of funds don’t have a strong social media network and are therefore unable to raise funds online without the help of ads. They either succumb to their pain or die if not supported by ads to get donations from people across the globe.</p>
<p>How to stop ZedAid ads?</p>
<p>We are here to help, in order to mark you out of our ad targeting. We will need you to fill this form. Please mention all the email id’s that you use in your day to day life (personal as well as work). This way we can specifically mark you out of ad targeting. (link to google form)</p>
