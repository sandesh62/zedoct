This policy is in addition to your obligations under applicable laws on the prevention of money laundering and does not detract in any manner from those obligations. We urge you to be aware of your obligations under such applicable laws. ZedAid’s ability to comply with its obligations under applicable law is dependent on your cooperation and we seek your cooperation via this policy.</li>

<ol>
<li>“Money laundering” is largely understood to mean any act or attempt (directly or indirectly and even by association in one step of a series of transactions) to conceal or disguise the origin and ownership of proceeds obtained illegally, such that it appears to have originated from legitimate sources; thus avoiding prosecution, conviction and confiscation of such proceeds. Terrorist organisations, tax evaders, smugglers, persons involved in bribery or any persons that receive money for illegal activities and/or through illegal means may launder money.</li>
<li>Recognising transactions involving money laundering requires awareness of possible suspicious activity, which may arise at any time. Below is an indicative list of actions that persons associated with ZedAid should be careful of. This list is not exhaustive, as every circumstance is not foreseeable. However, regardless of appearing together or individually, please be aware of the following situations that may be indications of money laundering activity:</li>

<p>(iii) Any person, including a ZedAid support staff, that is concerned about or seeks to avoid any reporting requirements or refuses to maintain required records;</p>
<p>(iv) Being a digital platform, Payments made in cash or cash equivalents are not applicable;</p>
<p>(v) Donations of large amounts that appear to be out of place or inconsistent with normal donation patterns, in the absence of any legitimate requirement for such donation;</p>
<p>(vi) Requests for payments to be made in unrelated countries or to third parties;</p>
<p>(vii) Multiple partial payments from various parties on behalf of a single user and/or multiple partial payments from various locations;</p>
<p>(viii) Users making payments in one form, then requesting refunds in other forms (for example, making payments by credit card, but requesting refunds in cash or by wire transfers);</p>
<p>(ix) Users making contributions, followed by immediate requests to wire out or transfer the funds to a third party or firm, without connected purposes;</p>
<p>(x) Users requesting for donations to be paid in cash or wired to a third party or firm, without connected purposes;</p>
