          <h2 class="case-b-title">PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
		<p><strong>Last updated November 23, 2020</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; Respecting Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Privacy is a fundamental right, and at Zed AID and its group companies, it is treated as such. This document sets forth our current policy in this regard.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; Sources of Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>Our business is founded on the principle that people matter. Respect for people is the foundation of our business. Respect for people includes respecting their right to privacy.</p>
<p>We are engaged in the business of using innovative ways to bring health to all in India. Our website seeks to bring cases of those in need of healthcare and other essential services to the attention of those in a position to make a difference and the opportunity to do so. The users of our website are those in need and those seeking to help.</p>
<p>In the conduct of our business, we collect and process personal data of our users and visitors. Personal data is collected in the course of transacting on the website. Personal data is also collected by Zed AID and its affiliates outside of website through in-person meetings, participation in conferences and other business forums, transaction or promotion of business, and with respect to job applicants, through job application materials and interviews. Personal data is also collected through social media; from solicited and unsolicited communications; responses to promotional and other materials, among others. If your personal data is available with us, more likely than not, it has been shared by you with us.</p>
<p>Data collection technologies built into our websites, telecommunication systems, digital advertising, social media, etc. are additional sources of personal data collection. In addition to personal data that a user voluntarily furnishes, these electronic systems also collect personal data without the knowledge of the user, including user’s preferences, frequency of access, IP addresses, type of browser, communication device or operating systems used, and geographic location, etc.</p>
<p>Separately, we also collect and process personal data of our employees and independent contractors at the time of, in the course of and following their retention.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; Processing of Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>We acquire, maintain and process personal data where it is necessary for the pursuit of legitimate business interests, balancing this interest against the data subject’s interests and fundamental rights. Legitimate interests include establishing and maintaining relationships, servicing their anticipated and actual needs, and for administrative purposes. Towards that end, we may use various contact management, analytics and processing software and other tools and techniques, including marketing by use of electronic means.</p>
<p>We may share personal data with entities that provide services to us, including companies that provide web analytics, advertising, email distribution and other services. The use of personal data by such companies is limited to the purpose of rendering the contracted services.</p>
<p>We may share personal data with one or more of our group companies for performance of business functions and for internal analytics. Some of our group companies or service providers may be located in jurisdictions that are outside of the jurisdiction of the personal data subject, or in jurisdictions that offer a lower level of privacy or data protection. In such circumstances, we have put in place appropriate safeguards in accordance with applicable law and in line with this policy.</p>
<p>We may also process personal data where it is necessary for entering into or performing under a contract. Finally, in certain circumstances, we may process personal data on the basis of consent of the data subject for specific purposes.</p>
<p>We may also use or disclose personal data if we are required by law to do so or if we reasonably believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with judicial or regulatory proceedings, a court order or other legal process. We do not otherwise disclose or sell to any third party any personal data that we collect or which comes into our possession without the consent of the data subject. The only exception to the foregoing is where any part of our business is sold to a third party, in which case the acquiror of the business will likely also acquire personal data in our possession or control.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp; Right to Object and Unsubscribe</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to object to your personal data being used for direct marketing by us. You may opt out by adjusting your communication preferences by logging into your profile and turning off the communication or by writing to [info@zedaid.org]. You also have the right to unsubscribe from electronic communications by utilizing the unsubscribe feature contained in our emails. Note that the unsubscribe feature contained in an email may unsubscribe you from only certain (but not all) kinds of electronic or non-electronic communications originating from us.</p>
<p>Also, by continuing to the next step, you are willingly giving Zed AID, permission to contact you or communicate to you and all the contacts given by you via whatsapp, email, sms, and other modes of notification.</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; Notice to EU Data Subjects</strong></p>
<p>As noted above, we process personal data with the consent of the data subject, to enter into or perform under a contract between us and the data subject or a business represented by the data subject, to comply with legal obligations, or where we have a legitimate interest to do so.</p>
<p>Further, as noted above, subject to the exceptions permitted by law, a data subject has the right to access her or his information, rectify or update such information, erase such information (subject to our need to retain certain information for legal or other purposes), receive a copy of the data subject’s information, and to object to or restrict the processing of such subject’s personal data. The data subject may do so by writing to us at [info@zedaid.org].</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp; Third-Party Activities</strong></p>
<p>Unaffiliated third parties, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. are providers of avenues, content, functionality and services for our web and social media sites. We do not control what and how these and other third parties collect personal data or how they use it. We do know, however, that in addition to using sophisticated technologies such as cookies and web beacons on web and social media sites, including sites such as ours, third parties routinely employ new and innovative tools, techniques and practices to collect, receive, process, buy and sell personal information over extended durations, build sophisticated user profiles and commercially exploit it. We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy and business practices of these third parties. Note here that certain of their activities can potentially be managed by users themselves, as for instance, through Internet browser and handheld app controls.</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp; Children’s Information</strong></p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or store personal data of children unless permitted by law or provided to us under a contract where a child is a beneficiary of a campaign. If we learn that we have collected personally identifiable information from a child without lawful authorization, we will delete that information from our database.</p>
<p><strong>8.&nbsp; Protecting Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>We use physical, technical and administrative measures to protect personal data against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. We strive to protect the information we maintain; however, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that is transmitted to or held by us because data transmission and storage is neither error-free nor completely secure.</p>
<p><strong>9.&nbsp; Data Retention</strong></p>
<p>We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected and processed, including for the purposes of satisfying any contractual, legal, regulatory, accounting or reporting obligations.</p>
<p><strong>10.&nbsp; Zed AID Advertisement and Targeting</strong></p>
<p>Advertisements are a basic need in today’s digital world for any organization to grow its digital footprint.</p>
<p>Zed AID leverages advertisements via various mediums to fulfill the donation needs of any of its numerous crowdfunding campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Why am I being shown so many ads from Zed AID?</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; Since you visited zedaid.org:</strong> In the past, you have visited Zed AID website or any campaign and support someone in need.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; Because you donated on Zed AID:</strong> In the past, you have helped someone get through their tough time by donating to their campaign.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; Affinity Targeting:</strong> According to advertising platforms like Youtube, Facebook, Google, etc, you are among the people who care for social causes and feel compassionate about other people who are going through pain.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp; You follow us on social media:</strong> You are currently following Zed AID (or used to follow Zed AID) on one of the social media platforms that Zed AID has a presence on.</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; You have helped someone:</strong> by sharing, liking, commenting or promoting their crowdfunding campaign in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Why does Zed AID need to show ads?</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; By showing ads to people across the world, Zed AID has been able to raise donations and help thousands of people.</p>
<p>We have raised 200+ Crores with the help of advertisements.</p>
<p>This, in turn, has helped over 10,000+ patients live a healthy disease-free life.</p>
<p>We have fundraised for more than 2000 NGO’s who support many social causes.</p>
<p>The donations collected on our platform have helped give a second life to thousands of people, who would have otherwise been left untreated.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; Zed AID is trying to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>Zed AID uses technology to bring people together and help each other. Basically we connect beneficiaries, patients in need with donors. Often advertisements help us break the clutter and reach out to people like you and help people in need.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp; Urgent support: Many times, people need donations urgently and do not have any time to wait for people to find their campaign. Zed AID helps them to reach their target fast by promoting their campaigns.</p>
<p>If not for advertisements, they might lose their loved ones forever.</p>
<p>Many surgeries and treatments need your support in a matter of hours and there is no other way to collect donations that fast without promoting ads to collect it.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp; Lack of personal resources: Many underprivileged people, who come from low-income backgrounds and need a large sum of funds don’t have a strong social media network and are therefore unable to raise funds online without the help of ads. They either succumb to their pain or die if not supported by ads to get donations from people across the globe.</p>
<p>I still don’t care. I don’t want to see the ads. How to stop Zed AID ads?</p>
<p>We are here to help, in order to mark you out of our ad targeting. We will need you to fill this form. Please mention all the email id’s that you use in your day to day life (personal as well as work). This way we can specifically mark you out of ad targeting. (link to google form)</p>
